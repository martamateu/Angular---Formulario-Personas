#### Pr√°ctica Angular

It is proposed to generate a form with Angular that allows you to create, edit, modify and delete a list of people.

To do this you can use the class created in TypeScript practice, Persona, although it will not be necessary to provide the fields Address, Telephone and Mail.

When creating or editing a person it will be necessary to perform the following validations on the data:

-You must be able to register new people and view them in a list.
-All records must be amenable.
-All records must be erased.
-Angular-material must be used.
-Dates must be displayed in dd/mm/yyyy format.
-Check that the ID has 9 characters.
-Check that the Name, Surname and ColorFavorito have at least 3 characters.
-It shall be checked that the age is between 0 and 125.
-Sex must be selected from the values Male, Female, Other and Unspecified.
